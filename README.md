## Documentation

__GameCenter.authenticatePlayer(success, error)__  
Displays the Game Center login UI, or automatically log the player in if they've previously authenticated. The _success_ callback is passed 
an object which looks like the following: __{ authenticated: true, playerID: XXXXX, alias: "Public display name" }__. The _error_ callback 
is passed a string which gives details about the error.

__GameCenter.reportScore(score, category, success, error)__  
Send a _score_ to a Game Center leaderboard, represented by the _category_ string. _category_ must be the identifier that you set up for the 
leaderboard in iTunes Connect. The _error_ callback is passed a string which gives details about the error. The plugin doesn't save/resend 
scores if there was a transmission failure; it's up to you to keep track of which scores were successfully sent. A common technique for this 
is to save your scores in an array, iterate/send each one, and _splice_ the score out of the array if it was successfully sent. 

__GameCenter.showLeaderboard(category, time, success, error)__  
Display the "native" Game Center UI for the _category_ leaderboard. _category_ must be the identifier that you set up for the 
leaderboard in iTunes Connect. _time_ is a string representing the time interval of displayed scores. Acceptable values are "day," "week," 
or "all." The _error_ callback is passed a string which gives details about the error. 

__GameCenter.retrieveScores(category, friends, time, range, success, error)__  
Get an array of high scores to use in your own custom UI. _category_ must be the identifier that you set up for the 
leaderboard in iTunes Connect. _friends_ is the string "global" or "friends" to show scores from friends only. _time_ 
is a string representing the time interval of displayed scores. Acceptable values are "day," "week," 
or "all." _range_ is the number of returned results, from 1 to 100 (the default is 25). _success_ is passed the array of scores, while
 _error_ is passed a string which gives details about the error. 

__GameCenter.loadAchievements(success, error)__  
Get the status of all achievements. _success_ callback receives an array with objects representing each achievement. Note that you need 
to call this method before reporting any achievement progress.

Update the completion percentage (_percent_) of a particular achievement with ID _identifier_.
